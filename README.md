COPYRIGHT 2019 Kiri Choi

Evolutionary Algorithm-based Model Ensemble Generation (evoMEG) is a meta-modeling algorithm for biochemical reaction network models that generates a model ensemble from perturbation studies.

## How to use

The algorithm ca be executed by simply running `main.py`. To change the algorithm settings, modify the `main.py`.
